Create an “Agents” section for a modern DevOps AI platform named DevOps Ghostwriter. The section should visually explain a multi-agent architecture in a clean, professional, and interactive way, matching an existing dark, premium, developer-first UI.

Design language:

Dark background (#0A0809)

Elevated cards using dark grays (#171717, #202023)

Primary text color #F8F7F8

Muted secondary text (#A1A1A1, #71717A)

Accent color #69E300 used sparingly for active states and highlights

No gradients, no flashy neon, no clutter

Section Layout:

Section Header (Top Centered)

Title: “Autonomous AI Agents”

Subtitle:
Specialized agents collaborate to review pull requests, validate runtime behavior, audit security, and generate documentation — fully automated and observable.

Clean spacing, calm typography, no icons here

Agent Architecture Overview (Visual Flow)

Horizontal or vertical flow showing:
Orchestrator Agent → Specialist Agents → Final Verdict

Thin connecting lines between agents

Subtle animated pulse on active nodes using green accent

Label the pattern:
Parallel Fan-Out / Gather Architecture

Agent Cards Grid (Core Content)
Display four interactive agent cards, each with consistent styling and hover effects.

Agent Card Structure (for all cards):

Icon (minimal, abstract — no emojis)

Agent name (bold)

Role subtitle (muted)

Short professional description

Capabilities list (3–4 bullets)

Status indicator (idle / running / completed)

Agents to Include:

Orchestrator Agent

Interactivity & Motion

Cards elevate slightly on hover

Green accent appears on active agent

Smooth transitions (no aggressive animations)

Optional: click expands card to show sample output or logs

Trust & Observability Callout (Bottom)

Short statement:
Every agent action is fully traceable and observable via Weights & Biases.

Minimal icon + link styled button: “View Sample Trace”

Button uses green accent, outlined style

UX Constraints:

No marketing fluff

No emojis

No bright colors

Must feel like an engineering product

Section must smoothly scroll into view from navbar click

Emotional Goal:
The user should understand in under 10 seconds that this platform runs multiple specialized AI agents working together, not a single LLM.
